# php-LostAndFound
This is a web app where users register a lost item or look for their lost item.
Shops and restaurants register the lost item that were delivered to them.
Users can lookm for their lost item in this app and reduce their time making unnecessary phone calls.
(I did not create the login page for register page)

I deleted the part with my mySQL username and password. Instead it saids "USERNAME HERE" and "PASSWORD HERE", so please enter yours. For the google maps api key, enter your key where it saids "KEY HERE" 


Language and Tools Used

The index page has 2 buttons. One that directs to found.html and another to lost.html
